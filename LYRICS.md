_Push it to the limit_

_Walk along the razor's edge_

_but don't look down, just keep your head_

_and you'll be finished_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Open up the limit_

_past the point of no return_

_You've reached the top but still you gotta learn_

_how to keep it_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Hit the wheel and double the stakes_

_throttle wide open like a bat out of hell_

_and you crash the gates_

_(crash the gates)_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Going for the back of beyond_

_Nothing gonna stop you_

_there's nothing that strong_

_So close now you're nearly at the brink_

_so, push it_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Welcome to the limit_

_(The limit)_

_Take it maybe one step more_

_The power game's still playing so_

_you better win it_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Push it to the limit_

_(The limit)_

_With no one left to stand in your way_

_you might get careless, but you'll never be safe_

_while you still feel it_

ğŸ’°ğŸ’°ğŸ’°

_Welcome to the limit_

_(The limit)_

_Standing on the razor's edge_

_don't look down just keep your head_

_and you'll be finished_
